# Credit Verification and Prequalification System

## Overview
The Credit Verification and Prequalification System is designed to streamline the credit application process for banking and financial institutions. By leveraging modern web technologies, this system provides a user-friendly platform that enables bank analysts to efficiently review and manage credit applications, while also allowing applicants to easily submit their information and required documents.

## Purpose
The system aims to reduce the time and errors associated with manual credit verification by incorporating automated document analysis, risk assessment, and fraud detection. It provides an initial prequalification based on the information extracted from submitted documents, which serves as a first filter for approval.

## Key Features
- **Document Upload and Classification:** Users can upload necessary documents, such as IDs, proof of income, and bank statements, with options to select the type of document being uploaded.
- **Dashboard for Bank Analysts:** A centralized dashboard for bank analysts to view, filter, and search through submitted applications. It includes a visual indicator for applications with issues.
- **Application Review:** Detailed application review page with applicant information, document status, credit score, and risk assessment. Analysts can approve, reject, or request more information.
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Integrated search bar and filter options in the dashboard to enhance application management and accessibility.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive and accessible on various devices, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

## Target Audience
The primary users of the system are bank and financial institution employees responsible for reviewing and approving credit applications. The secondary users are applicants who use the platform to submit their credit requests and monitor the status of their applications.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Developed using modern JavaScript frameworks with a focus on user experience and responsiveness.
- **Backend:** Handles data processing, document analysis, and API integrations for credit verification and risk assessment.
